A few assumptions:
-	Discount application checked after each scan (rather than on "Finish Scanning")
-	Each individual line item to be added for applied discount, instead of a cumulative total of discount. e.g. if offer applies to 2 items of a certain type, it will add two discount entries if 4 items added to the basket
-	There is only one offer per SKU.
- Prices to be locked while adding to basket
